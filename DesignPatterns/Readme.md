## Design Patterns

A design pattern is a reusable, general solution to a common problem in software design. 
It represents best practices that developers can follow to solve specific design challenges in a systematic and efficient way. 
Design patterns are not finished designs that can be directly converted into code; rather, they are templates that guide the development process.

**Why Use Design Patterns?**
1. Improves Code Reusability: Patterns provide tried-and-tested solutions, saving development time and effort. 
2. Enhances Code Readability and Maintainability: Using common patterns helps new team members understand the code more quickly, as the patterns are well-documented and widely understood. 
3. Promotes Best Practices: Encourages developers to follow standard principles such as SOLID, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and separation of concerns. 
4. Reduces Development Risks: Helps avoid common pitfalls by providing proven solutions to recurring problems. 
5. Facilitates Code Scalability: Patterns provide a foundation for building flexible and extensible systems. 
6. Supports Communication: Using familiar patterns creates a shared language among developers, making discussions and reviews more efficient.


**Types of Design Patterns**:  
Design patterns are broadly categorized into three types:
1. **Creational Patterns:**  
   Deal with object creation mechanisms.  
   Examples:Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype.
      
2. **Structural Patterns:** 
   Focus on object composition and the organization of classes and objects.  
   Examples: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade. 
3. **Behavioral Patterns:**  
   Deal with communication and the interaction between objects.  
   Examples: Observer, Strategy, Command, Iterator, State.
